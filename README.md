# HarrisonBot
Our friend Harrison wouldn't join us on Slack, so we made a NodeJS based bot version of him to talk with us.

# Usage
* Bot is invoked from the trigger words "Harrison", "harrison", "HarrisonBot", or "harrisonbot"
* Anytime the bot is invoked, it returns a random string from the responses.json file. Pull requests for responses definitely welcomed!
* Currently integrated this repo into an Azure Website, hooked up at [http://harrisonbot.azurewebsites.net](http://harrisonbot.azurewebsites.net")

* Bot powered via NodeJS
